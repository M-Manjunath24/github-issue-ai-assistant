# AI-Powered GitHub Issue Assistant

An AI-powered web application that analyzes GitHub issues and provides structured insights such as summaries, issue type, priority, suggested labels, and potential impact.

This project fetches issue data from GitHub, processes it using a locally hosted Phi-3 language model via Ollama, and serves results through a FastAPI backend with a Streamlit frontend.
